## 2022-06-25

* Discussed different methods to build robot
* Everyone listed pros of their method, and were put on the spot to try and come up with solutions to the cons brought up by peers (specifics listed below)
* Eventually decided to go with the standard "6-motor" design where frame wraps around cube and individual motors control sides
 * Agreed that this would be te easiest to program, along with being fast and efficient and relatively simple mechanically without complicated gearing or heavy reliance on 3d-printed, custom parts
 * Discussed ways to assemble frame for structure
 * Discussed ways to mount Motor (c-channel, l-channel, or flat metal strip) and ways to mount Vision Sensor at optimal angle (zip ties, brackets, MPL 3D printers and TinkerCad) 
 * Discussed ways to "hold" the rubiks cube (glue, rubber, frame, or MPL 3D Printers and TinkerCad) 
 * Currently prefering l/c-channels for motor attatchment and exploring 3D printing options for the rest
* Created rough sketches (coming soon) of the robot
* Mapped out a parts list (below) based on design (not final yet, first draft)
* Specifics of different design's pros and cons:
  * Rubix "1.0" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGxpXlIaIaA)
